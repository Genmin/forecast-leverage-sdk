## Critical Bug Fix

### Problem
Previous commit incorrectly changed simulation loop formula based on misunderstanding of protocol mechanics.

**Wrong formula**:
```typescript
remainingUSDC = tokensThisLoop * leverageParams.F;
```

**Result**: Exponential growth (6.6M tokens, 2659x leverage) - WRONG

**Correct formula**:
```typescript
remainingUSDC = tokensThisLoop * leverageParams.F * params.currentPrice;
```

**Result**: Convergent geometric series (16k tokens, 6.51x leverage) - CORRECT

### Root Cause
Confusion between two different concepts:

1. **Protocol lending mechanics** (exact):
   - Deposit X tokens
   - Protocol pairs with X tokens from junior pool
   - Creates X sets of collateral (each worth $1)
   - Protocol lends `X * F` USDC

2. **Simulation model** (simplified):
   - Simplified leverage model for estimation
   - Borrow F * (token value) in USDC
   - Creates convergent geometric series: capital * (1-F^n)/(1-F)
   - Easier for integrators to understand

The simulation uses the simplified model, NOT the exact protocol mechanics. This is intentional and correct.

### What Was Kept

1. **Runway validation** ✓
   - Formula: `runway = (1 - F) / (F * R) * year`
   - Prevents positions where debt > collateral
   - Correctly validated by tests

2. **Improved loop count formula** ✓
   - Old formula returned `Infinity` (division by zero)
   - New formula: `N = log(0.1) / log(F)` to reach 90% of max
   - Correctly achieves target leverage

3. **Protocol documentation** ✓
   - Helps integrators understand real protocol mechanics
   - Clarified that simulation uses simplified model

## Mathematical Validation

### Geometric Series Formula
```
Total tokens = (capital / price) * (1 - F^n) / (1 - F)
```

With F=0.9, n=10, capital=1000, price=0.40:
```
multiplier = (1 - 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9)
          = (1 - 0.3487) / 0.1
          = 6.513

total = (1000 / 0.40) * 6.513
      = 2500 * 6.513
      = 16,282.5 ≈ 16,283 tokens
```

Simulation matches formula exactly (0% error).

### Runway Formula
```
Debt per set = F * (1 + R * time/year)
Runway when debt = 1: time = (1 - F) / (F * R) * year
```

With F=0.9, R=0.10:
```
runway = (1 - 0.9) / (0.9 * 0.10) * year
       = 0.1 / 0.09 * year
       = 1.111 * year
       = 9,733.3 hours
```

At runway:
```
debt = 0.9 * (1 + 0.10 * 1.111)
     = 0.9 * (1 + 0.1111)
     = 0.9 * 1.1111
     = 1.0000
```

Formula matches verification exactly (0% error).

## Conclusion

SDK simulation formulas are mathematically correct and validated by tests. The geometric series formula produces accurate leverage estimates for integrators.

The confusion arose from attempting to match simulation to exact protocol mechanics, when simulation intentionally uses a simplified model for ease of understanding.
